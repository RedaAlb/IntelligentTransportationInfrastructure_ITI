Please note, this repo is still in early stages and will be finalised when concrete outcomes are achieved.

## Project outline.

This is a project that I am undertaking as a research associate at the University of Westminster.

This project involves two main components:

1. Detection and recognition of:
    1. Indian Licence plates (LP)
    1. Vehicle types (VT)
1. Public transportation recommendation tool (TRT)

At this current time and state, the project is solely focused on the first part.



## 1. For LP and VT detection and recognition

Please refer to the `\LP_VT_det_rec` directory.


## 2. For TRT

To be added.
