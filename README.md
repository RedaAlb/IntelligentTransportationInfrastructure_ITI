# Project outline.

This is a project that I am undertaking as a research associate at the University of Westminster. It involves creating an automatic number-plate recognition (ALPR) system. It is split into three main stages, vehicle detection (VD), licence plate detection (LPD) and LP recognition (LPR). A vehicle type classifier (VTC) is also made to classify the detected vehicles into trucks and emergency vehicles.


# Notes

- To run the ALPR pipeline, please refer to `/darknet`.
- For the datasets used, please refer to `/datasets`.
- For only the VTC stage, please refer to `/vtc`.
