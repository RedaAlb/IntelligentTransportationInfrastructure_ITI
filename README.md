Traffic noise exposure, air-pollution, road injuries, and traffic delays are some of the major problems with which residents are faced with on a daily basis in urban areas. This project refers to the modern vision of an intelligent transportation infrastructure system that will be capable to monitor vehicles behaviour, air-pollution, weather conditions, traffic jams, in order to improve the quality of life of city residents. This ITI system will be applied to Indiaâ€™s urban environment.
