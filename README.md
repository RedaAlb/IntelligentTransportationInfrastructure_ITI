## Project outline.

This is a project that I am undertaking as a research associate at the University of Westminster. It involves creating an automatic number-plate recognition (ALPR) system. It is split into three main stages, vehicle detection (VD), licence plate detection (LPD) and LP recognition (LPR). A vehicle classifier is also made to classify the detected vehicles into trucks and emergency vehicles.


## For VD/LP detection and recognition

Please refer to the `\LP_VT_det_rec` directory.


## For vehicle type classification (VTC)

Please refer to the `\vtc` directory.
